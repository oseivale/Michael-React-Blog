<h3>
A basic blog site, using ReactJS, CSS and any additional tools you wish to use to build the other functionality.
</h3>

<p>This site should allow a user to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a blog article</li>
  <li>View a blog artical</li>
  <li>Edit a blog artical</li>
  <li>Delete a Blog article</li>
</ul>

Each page/view should be styled using CSS/additional CSS library if you like.

Make sure to set up your components using best practices to ensure the correct props are passed where and when they need to be.

You can go about this however you wish. But this is an example of a typical blog site that you can use as a reference:
